Secure payment options will be provided to enable customers to purchase products. Upon successful transactions, artisans will receive payment, and customers will receive confirmation emails.
# Chat Feature:
A chat feature will facilitate direct communication between customers and artisans. Customers can inquire about customized orders or seek clarification on products.

Integration with third-party authentication services like Google will enhance security and streamline the login process.
